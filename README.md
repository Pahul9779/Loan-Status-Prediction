# Loan Status Prediction

## Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting the **Loan Status** of applicants based on various attributes using machine learning techniques. The model aims to help financial institutions streamline loan approvals by accurately assessing the likelihood of loan repayment.

## Features
- **Data Cleaning**: Handled missing values and anomalies.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualized the distribution of data and key relationships between variables.
- **Feature Engineering**: Created additional features to enhance model performance.
- **Model Selection**: Tested various models to identify the best-performing algorithm.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Analyzed model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Dataset
The dataset includes features like:
- **Applicant Income**  
- **Coapplicant Income**  
- **Loan Amount**  
- **Credit History**  
- **Property Area**  
- **Loan Status** (Target variable)

**Dataset Path:** Refer to the `Loan_Status.ipynb` file for data source and preprocessing steps.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Libraries**: 
  - Pandas
  - NumPy
  - Matplotlib
  - Scikit-learn
